# PokemonVAE-pytorch

A Vartiational autoencoder which compresses pokemon 120x120 images to a desired LATENT_DIM varible. 
Inside the VAE.py files you can determind which functions should be run. For instance train().

I know it is not the most optimised interface but it works nevertheless.

Enjoy!
